As a programmer: this should be thrown `syntax error`.

As a mathematician: `b` should be considered a multiplicant of `(c+d)`, before all of them being divided by `a`.

Then why implement it as the mathematician said? Ok, let's find out.

How to Use?
-----------

Inside this dir, just

    python3 calculator

Here are something I recommend you to try out:

    >>> 9/3(2+1)
    1.0
    >>> 10(9(8(7(6(5(4(3(2(1)))))))))
    3628800
    >>> (1+2j)(3-4j)
    (11+2j)

What's Differ from Python?
--------------------------

- `int`, `float`, `complex` are now callable.
- `real`, `imag`, `conjugate` became functions.
