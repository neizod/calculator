Calculator the Right Way
========================

so many people argue on this:

[[ pic a/b(c+d) ]]

as a programmer: this should throw `syntax error`.

as a mathematician: `b` should be considered a multiplicant of `(c+d)`, before all of them being divided by `a`.

How to Use?
-----------

inside this dir, just

    python3 calculator

this is something i recommend you to try out:

    9/3(2+1)
    (1 + 2j)(2 + 1j)
    2**3(4)
    1(2(3(4(5(6(7(8(9))))))))
